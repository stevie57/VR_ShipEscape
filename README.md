# VR_ShipEscape
 A 3-person Multiplayer VR prototype

This prototype project used a combination of both Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit and Autohand for the player VR Controls. I purcahsed Autohand during Unity's Lightning deal and decided to use this project to test out its functioanlity. 

The main benefit of Autohand VR hands was the hand grab autoposing which allowed for quick realstic grab interactions using the various gadgets in the player level.
